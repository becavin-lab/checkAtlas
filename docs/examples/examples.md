# Examples

A list of Checkatlas results on different atlases configuration
## Example 1 - Evaluate and compare heterogenous scanpy atlases

Evaluate and compare different atlases:
[Example 1](CheckAtlas_example_1/Checkatlas_MultiQC.html)

This example has been generated with [1-Atlas_comparison.ipynb](jupyter/1-Atlas_comparison.ipynb) which you can downlad and run in checkatlas/examples/jupyter/ folder.

## Example 2 - Evaluate different version of the same atlas

Evaluate different version of your atlas:
[Example 2](CheckAtlas_example_2/Checkatlas_MultiQC.html)

This example has been generated with [2-Version_comparison.ipynb](jupyter/2-Version_comparison.ipynb) which you can downlad and run in checkatlas/examples/jupyter/ folder.

## Example 3 - Evaluate Scanpy, Seurat and CellRanger atlases

Evaluate Scanpy, Seurat and CellRanger objects in your folder:
[Example 3](CheckAtlas_example_3/Checkatlas_MultiQC.html)

This example has been generated with [3-AtlasType_comparison.ipynb](jupyter/3-AtlasType_comparison.ipynb) which you can downlad and run in checkatlas/examples/jupyter/ folder.

## Example 4 - Evaluate post-process and raw atlases

Evaluate an integrated Scanpy atlas with the corresponding raw CellRanger atlases:
[Example 3](CheckAtlas_example_4/Checkatlas_MultiQC.html)

This example has been generated with [4-AtlasRawvsFinal_comparison.ipynb](jupyter/4-AtlasRawvsFinal_comparison.ipynb) which you can downlad and run in checkatlas/examples/jupyter/ folder.

## Example 5 - Avaluate different cellranger version atlases

Evaluate different Cellranger atlases with multiple chemistry version and cellranger version:
[Example 3](CheckAtlas_example_5/Checkatlas_MultiQC.html)

This example has been generated with [5-CellRanger_comparison.ipynb](jupyter/5-CellRanger_comparison.ipynb) which you can downlad and run in checkatlas/examples/jupyter/ folder.
